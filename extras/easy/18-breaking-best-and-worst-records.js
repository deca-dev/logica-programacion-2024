/*
Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Example

scores = [12,24,10,24]

Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

                                     Count
    Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
     0      12     12       12       0   0
     1      24     12       24       0   1
     2      10     10       24       1   1
     3      24     10       24       1   1
Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

She broke her best record twice (after games  and ) and her worst record four times (after games , , , and ), so we print 2 4 as our answer. Note that she did not break her record for best score during game , as her score during that game was not strictly greater than her best record at the time.
